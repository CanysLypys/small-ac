README for FiveM script:

[Free] Standalone Anti-Blacklist TriggerEvent & Trigger Count Limit

Hello everyone,

Today, I'm sharing my free standalone script for FiveM, which serves as an anti-cheat measure against Blacklisted TriggerEvent abuse and excessive trigger usage on the server.

The script works by tracking the execution of Blacklisted TriggerEvents and checking how often certain triggers are triggered within a set time period. If a Blacklisted TriggerEvent is detected or a trigger exceeds the set limit, the affected player will be automatically banned.

**Features**
* Automatic print when a blacklisted trigger is detected.
* Automatic print if a player exceeds a set trigger limit within a certain time frame
* Easy configuration by editing the trigger arrays in the script (ServerSide)
* You can use both client and serverside triggers
* No dependencies on other resources

The script is easy to install and use. Simply add the file to your resources directory and start it in your server configuration file.

Here's the download link to my Github repository: [Latest Release](https://github.com/DarkHypothesise/small-ac)

I hope this script will help other server administrators increase server security and improve the player experience on their FiveM servers.

Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!

Enjoy the script!
